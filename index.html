                    <p>
Watching the final inning of an elimination game can be controversial.  Every player going to the plate is potentially a
hero or a goat.  Every pitch is potentially a game changer or a crushing blow.  One of these nail biting situations was in Game #6 of
the ALCS - Wade Davis was in the game to close things out, but Toronto was able to get runners to second and third
with one out (as Dioner Navarro had struck out looking).  Ultimately, there was no game changing to this story as Davis
struck out Ben Revere and managed to get Josh Donaldson to grounded out.
                    </p>
                    <p>
With the game in the books, you wonder if the baseball gods coin flip just came up Kansas City that night.  Could we weight
attribution more to Wade Davis' performance?  Or were there any indicators that the outs made could be attributed to
plate approach?
                    </p>
                    <p>
A dashboard has been created to illustrate the latter question.  Let's take a look at the three last batters outed in that elimination
game to see what's interesting.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <img class="img-responsive" src="img/dashboard-tor.png" alt="">
                    </p>
                    <p>
Before analyzing the data, let's walk through the dashboard and explain what the visualizations are showing.  On the left hand
side, there is trending data for the player's plate approach score.  Each player's pane has a grey strip with a dark
grey line down the middle.  This dark thin line represents the mean score.  The light grey area represents where fifty percent
of the data points fall.  The score is optimizing towards line drives (more on this in the following sections).  Some other
important notes to the trend line:
                        <ul>
                            <li>if trending above the mean, it represents a good approach to hitting line drives (or being "locked in")</li>
                            <li>if trending below the mean, it could possibly represent a different hitting approach or possible struggles</li>
                            <li>if a player is focusing on hitting line drives, the trend line should be tight to the grey area when successful</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
To the right and below the filters, there is a box plot showing the same data as a snapshot for the period.  The whiskers represent the lower
and upper quartiles.  This view allows us to compare player profiles.  Notice that Ben Revere has a higher mean score (17.7) than
Dioner Navarro (14.4) and Josh Donaldson (9.4).  This doesn't indicate that Revere is any better of a hitter, but that he profiles as a
line drive hitter more often (and for which he does get credited, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Revere#Offense).  More
information on how the score is calculated will be discussed in following sections.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Let's get back to analysis.  Taking a look at the dashboard again, the insight that sticks out is that Revere starts
                        to negatively deviate from his profile during the playoffs.  Starting October 3rd against Chris Archer, he drops
                        to the lower quartile and never recovers.  At his last sample taken (which is October 23rd against Yordano Ventura),
                        his score is -88.3 which is 106 points away from his mean.
                    </p>
                    <p>
It is important to note that a player's success or slump doesn't hinge on his plate approach score.  Going back to Ben Revere, he started his
time with Toronto going 0 for 13.  His plate approach score indicates that he was still hovering close to his normal.  Going onwards to Aug. 21st to 29th,
he had an 8 game hitting streak which bumped is batting average significantly.  However, his plate approach score simply indicates that he
was locked in close to his normal.  It is not until the playoffs that his plate approach score takes a dive.  If we take a look at this 
the weekly line drive count in his last month of baseball for 2015 it goes 10, 7, 0, and 2.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So, the dashboard indicates that Revere was struggling with his plate approach come the Kansas City series.
                        This intelligence could be used to go back to see what he was doing in his at bats prior to October 3rd when
                        he was more "locked in".
                    </p>

                    <p>
Offensive production rates are prone to rise and fall during hot streaks and slumps.  It can be difficult to determine whether
these periods are due to the quality of plate approach or some other factor.  For instance, a batter's average may
drop over a period due to facing quality pitching despite maintaining a good approach.  In contrast, a batter
may be maintaining his good offense through some seeing eye singles.  The following analysis and methodology will focus on
uncoupling some of these other factors.  The goal is to have a metric that can gauge whether a batter is trending away from
their mean approach.  Also, it provides a clear visual indicating when a batter starts to deviate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
The following few sections explains how to arrive at a measure for Plate Approach.  If you would like to start

                    <h2 class="section-heading" id="controlled-samples">Selecting Controlled Samples</h2>
                    <p>
Let's define a sample as a pitcher going through the batting order.  This should give us roughly 2 to 3 sample sets of
data per game per team to use for analysis.  Note that these samples will be against starting pitchers and long relievers.
In this way, we can control factors such as:
                        <ul>
                            <li>pitcher's fatigue level - each sample is limited to roughly 40 to 50 pitches</li>
                            <li>environmental factors - each sample is on the same day/night under the same weather conditions</li>
                            <li>home plate umpire</li>
                            <li>manager's playing matchups</li>
                        </ul>
The methodology to attach the sample numbers to the original data set are found in the last section on this page (<a href="#methodology">click here</a>)
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading" id="defining-qpa">Defining Plate Approach Optimizing to Line Drives (PAoLD)</h2>
                    <p>
Let's start with a simple premise.  Each time a batter swings his intention is to put the ball in play.  There are situations
where a batter may be spoiling a pitch, but let's keep it simple for now.  If we count the number of swings to an event, we
have a measure of success (the lower being prefered).  To go one step further, I decided to track the number of swings to
a line drive.  This seems to be a good proxy for a quality hit towards the minimum viable product.
                    </p>
                    <p>
Next, we only consider our controlled samples when we count the swings to a line drive.  Once a line drive is hit (within a
controlled sample), then we can reset and start from zero.
                    </p>
                    <p>
So now, we have sample sets (with nine players in each of them) with how many swings they have taken until they last hit a line
drive.  Let's transform those numbers into a score by finding the mean and calculating their standard deviation from the
mean (<a href="#query-stddev-from-mean">see how this was derived from the dimensional model</a>).  Since I used a normal distribution,
99.7% of the data is within 3 standard deviations. To convert the number to look more like a score, I multiplied by -3/100.  A 
negative was used so visually we can see an upward trend as positive when we start to look at the Dashboard.

To summarize, controlled samples were created to compare the batter's ability to produce a line drive in the fewest number of
swings.  The sample assumes everyone is trying to put the ball in play and that line drives will serve as proxy to a quality
hit.

                    <h2 class="section-heading" id="dashboard-how-to">Dashboard (How To Use)</h2>
                    <p>
Data for all the Hackathon judges' teams have been included.  Most likely, the starting state of the dashboard will show
too many players to observe insight.  To filter down data:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Use the "Date" range filter in the top-right corner</li>
                            <li>Enter in a player's team into the "Batter" filter underneath the Date filter
                                <ul>
                                    <li>"COL*" for Colorado Rockies</li>
                                    <li>"CLE*" for Cleveland Indians</li>
                                    <li>"DET*" for Detroit Tigers</li>
                                    <li>"MIL*" for Milwaukee Brewers</li>
                                    <li>"MIN*" for Minnesota Twins</li>
                                    <li>"NYM*" for New York Mets</li>
                                    <li>"PIT*" for Pittsburgh Pirates</li>
                                    <li>"TOR*" for Toronto Blue Jays</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Also, partial player names may be entered (ex. "Cutch" for Andrew McCutchen)</li>
                        </ol>
Once the list of players has been pared down, you may want to exclude certain players from the dashboard.  This can be done
by right-clicking on a player's name and choosing exclude.  At any time, you may press "Reset" in the bottom right of the dashboard
to go back to the original state.
